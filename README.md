# Python Code Generator README

This repository contains Python code that utilizes OpenAI's API to generate and improve Python code. The code performs various transformations and improvements on user prompts using OpenAI's model.

## Getting Started

To use this code, you'll need an OpenAI API key. Make sure you have it available in the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

This code utilizes the `openai` and `termcolor` Python packages. You can install them using the following command:

```shell
pip install openai termcolor
```

## Usage

To use the code, run the following command:

```shell
python demo.py "user_prompt"
```

Replace `"user_prompt"` with your desired prompt. The code will generate and improve Python code based on the prompt.

## Functions

### `get_openai_api_key()`

This function retrieves the OpenAI API key from the environment variables. If the key is not found, a `ValueError` is raised.

#### Returns

- `str`: The OpenAI API key.

### `generate_response_from_chat(model_name: str, system_message: str, user_message: str)`

This function queries the OpenAI API to get the assistant's response.

#### Arguments

- `model_name` (str): Name of the OpenAI model to be used.
- `system_message` (str): System message setting context for the conversation.
- `user_message` (str): User message to generate a response to.

#### Returns

- `str`: Assistant's response generated by OpenAI.

### `save_output_to_file(output: str, filename: str = 'demo.py')`

This function saves the provided output to a file.

#### Arguments

- `output` (str): The content to be saved.
- `filename` (str, optional): The name of the file. Defaults to `'demo.py'`.

### `main()`

This function handles operations for code generation and improvements using OpenAI. The function reads a user prompt, performs transformations and improvements on it using OpenAI's model, and prints each transformation with a specific color.

## Configurations

The code includes a dictionary `OPERATIONS` that contains different operations to be performed on the user prompt. Each operation is associated with a specific color for printing. Modify this dictionary to add, remove, or change the operations.

The variable `MODEL_NAME` contains the name of the OpenAI model to be used.

The variable `SYSTEM_PROMPT` sets the system message used to provide context for the conversation.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the code:

```shell
python3 generate_python.py "Make a script that:
- Print 'Hello, Name'
- 'Name' is the name of the person provided in the first command line argument
- If they don't include a name, print World
- If the name is not properly capitalized, capitalize the first letter
- Make sure the name is alpha characters only.  If not, fix it.
- Don't accept names longer than 100 characters
"
```

This command will refactor the provided code for clarity and reduce repetitions by incorporating additional functions.
